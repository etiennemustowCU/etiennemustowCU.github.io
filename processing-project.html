      <h3>Etienne Mustow</h3>
      <p> Hey, my name's Etienne but a lot of people call me Eti. I first started coding at a web development bootcamp in 2017 
          and later started working as a web developer. I wanted to pursue a degree but due to other commitments I wasn't able to so applied to City 
          due to some of the great support and resources!</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Soothing Solar System </h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
    City (2020). <br></br>
    
    This Processing project improved my understanding 
    of the use of array lists, loops, randomness, classes, objects, 2D/3D transformations and the sound library. 
    The stars were randomly generated hundred of times in a 2D array, stored in an arrray list and called again in the main draw() method.
    As for the planets, I initially created a centered sphere via transformation. Then using a Planet class, and a constructor with a lot of arguments,
    detailed out each planet according to its distance from the sun, colour, size, and speed of orbit. 
    The planet's draw method included some maths and 3D transformations to generate the circular orbit motion and the setting of the ring for Saturn.
    The backing track was added to fit the theme of "calms my nerves".
